My own practice on ASP.NET MVC

This is a practice project that I created to help myself move on from ASP.NET Web Form to MVC world.
It will require a SQL Server database "AdventureWorks2008R2" to provide the data.
Modify the connection string in web.config file to probably configure the database that will be used.
